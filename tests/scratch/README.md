Directory containing tmp test output files.
If there are any files left here after a test run 
besides this README, they should be deleted.

Note that the contents are not added to .gitignore
because this interferes with testing. Gitignored files
will get the IGNORED status and thus cannot be identified
as untracked or staged but not committed.
